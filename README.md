-  Color formatting
-  AVL binary tree
-  File system*

## Building
Hydrogen is written in ANSI C, so it should be supported by just about every C compiler.

All you need to do is include [hydrogen.c](hydrogen.c) as a source in your build system, and make sure to link the C math library `m`.

And thats it! (as far as I know)
